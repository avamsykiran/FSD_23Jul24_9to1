    Develop a Java Console Application To read
    the first name and last name of a user and 
    generate a mail id as per the below rules:
        (i) the mail id domain is 'cts.in'
        (ii) the mail id has to contain the exactly 12 charaters apart from the domain and @ symbol.
        (iii) the mail id is a combination of fist 6 letters from the first name and last 6 letters from the last name
        (iv) no specases are allowed. 
        (v) if the length of the name is not sufficient, the gap shall be filled by the most frequest letter of the full-name.

        Hint:

            1. declare a double dim array of size fullName.length,2
            2. in the first dim we will have char and in the second we will have its frequency
            3. iterate through the full name and count the freqeucny of each char in the full name

                john john

                'j' 2
                'o' 2
                'h' 2
                'n' 2
